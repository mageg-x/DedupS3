    featuresTitle: "Core Features",
    feature1Title: "Extreme Storage Efficiency",
    feature1Desc: "Achieve over 90% storage savings through global content deduplication and intelligent chunking strategy, significantly reducing storage costs.",
    feature2Title: "Full S3 Compatibility",
    feature2Desc: "100% compatible with Amazon S3 API, seamlessly integrating with existing S3 clients and applications without code modification.",
    feature3Title: "High Performance Compression",
    feature3Desc: "Integrated zstd compression algorithm with adaptive compression levels, providing excellent performance while maintaining high compression rates.",
    feature4Title: "Multiple Storage Backends",
    feature4Desc: "Support for local disks, standard S3, and other storage backends to meet different scenario requirements and deployment methods.",
    feature5Title: "Flexible Deployment",
    feature5Desc: "Support for standalone and cluster deployment modes, with flexible scaling from development testing to large-scale production environments.",
    feature6Title: "Data Security",
    feature6Desc: "End-to-end encryption, encrypted storage after compression, ensuring data security during transmission and storage.",
